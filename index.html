        <h2>Personal Bio</h2>
        <p>Hi everyone! I'm <strong>Dennis Nichols</strong>.</p>
        <p>I'm originally from Savannah, Georgia, USA and currently I am living in Medell&iacute;n, Colombia.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reading Sci-fi and Fantasy literature. A recent favorite of mine is <a

            by R.F. Kuang.</li>
          <li>Practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu occassionally.</li>

        <h2>Professional History and Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, I am attending an immersive bootcamp in software development with Code Fellows. My plan is to gain
          competency in software development and data science skills to combine with my experience and passion for
          public health and environmental issues.</p>

        <p> I have worked as public health professional and contractor for the CDC. I've learned a lot about how
          governmental scientific organizations function and am very thankful for the experience I've gained in this
          role.</p>

        <p>My particular interests (and the subject of my work at CDC) are in issues of Water and Sanitation, future
          climate challenges, and the application of geographical methods and technologies to improve public health
          research and practice. One of my personal goals is to become bilingual - to that end I have dedicated myself
          to independent Spanish learning for the last several years. In past summers I've made progress down this path
          while working on an environmental sampling project in Bolivia and taking classes in Peru - from this summer
          through next I will gain more experience and training in Spanish by living in Colombia, Chile, and Mexico.</p>

        <p>As a former nuclear reactor operator in the US Navy, I bring systems thinking, experience in
          multidisciplinary teams, and an ability to work in environments with a demanding operational tempo to any
          role. I am looking for a position with a social/health/environment-focused organization where my
          problem-solving skills are challenged and I have the opportunity to wear many hats.</p>
