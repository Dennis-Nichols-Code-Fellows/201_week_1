# About me project

This is a website to tell my story and show off some of my coding abilities.

### Tasks accomplished

- Listed bio, professional history, and educational history.
- Made a quiz for the user on my story.

### Resources used

- I took inspiration for coding my button from Ania Kubow's youtube tutorial. I have more notes on this process [here](https://dennis-nichols.github.io/yt_group_projects/rps1_notes_dn).
